# ML4HST_drone
Development modules for Drone-related activities during ML4HST University of Wyoming 2023

The structure for this repo will be as follows:

* dev_code/
    + directory containing the "best" working code for various DJI Tello related demos
* dev_code/quick_tests/
    + quick python scripts to test very minor functionalities

* old_code/
    + directory containing python scripts at various stages of production. These scripts should NOT be used but can be referenced for certain behaviors

* tello/
    + exported virtual environment to align on the Python Packages used

Drone Obstacle Dataset (./DRONE_OBSTACLES) can be found and downloaded from the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12EsJg-sO3LIuRX_C-Lc-aXwpTvWMLvBK?usp=sharing
    + Put this directory in the same directory as ~/ML4HST/dev_code/playground/reference_CNN_lightning_model/generate_obstacle_CNN_lightning.py (for now)
